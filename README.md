### 🧬 What I'm Building

I specialize in rethinking how legacy systems, semantic enrichment, and multi-agent orchestration come together — with a healthy dose of LLMs, CLI-driven pipelines, and a dash of dark wit. Here's what I'm currently shipping:

---

#### 🧠 [SemanticStack](https://github.com/mafflerbach/SemanticStack)

Semantic enrichment from text, logs, and code with:
- **Python LLM pipelines**
- **pgvector + Postgres**
- **Docker Compose orchestration**
- **Lightweight frontend with Vite**

> _Transform raw data into structured meaning — and search it semantically._

</p>

#### 🤖 [Neural Orchestrator](https://github.com/mafflerbach/neural-orchestrator)

An AI-powered backend conductor that lets you describe what you want in natural language, and it:
- Uses **LLMs + ChromaDB** to discover matching services
- Resolves contract dependencies automatically
- Chains execution and logs everything for traceability

> _It's like if Postman grew a brain and started delegating._

### 📌 Why These Projects?

**SemanticStack** was born from a frustration with flat data and shallow dashboards. It turns logs, code, and other chaos into meaning — searchable, traceable, human-adjacent meaning.  
**Neural Orchestrator** is what happens when you stare too long into the abyss of service spaghetti and decide, “What if services could *negotiate* their purpose?”

Together, they’re a statement: automation isn't enough — comprehension is the next frontier.

### 🧭 Currently Exploring

- Multi-agent systems & LLMs in orchestration
- Distributed tracing with semantic summaries
- AST-based PHP analysis pipelines in Rust
- The philosophy of “schema as law”

---

### 🕒 Now

**Replatforming legacy COBOL, dreaming of auto-semantic observability.**
